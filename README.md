 This is a simple calculator functionality achieved using Javascript. The logic is very simple with the minimum lines of code possible.
 
## Steps to execute this calculator:
- Download the entire code 
- Open up the index.html.

## Technologies used: 
- HTML
- CSS [style/Presentation]
- Javascript [Logic/Working of calculator]

## Working 
Step 1: We will create a folder anywhere in the computer, which will have three files — index.html, style.css, and script.js <br>
Step 2: Then we’ll open ‘index.html’ in text editor like Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime Text etc. The head section of the html file will be declared as follows. <br>
Step 3: In the body element, we’ll create a div element which will hold our calculator frame. Under div, we’ll create header element with no content inside and it will be our calculator’s screen. After creating header element, we’ll create a table element under div. This table element will hold six rows, i.e. tr and each tr element will contain three columns, . <br>
Step 4: Now lets style our calculator using CSS. The code will be as follows. <br>
Step 5: Now we’ll add interactivity to our static page. Let’s dive into the codes of JavaScript file “script.js”
